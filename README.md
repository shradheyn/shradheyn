### 👋 About Me

I'm **Shradhey Naudiyal**, a Computer Science student with a passion for building tech-driven solutions and learning cutting-edge tools every day. I’m especially curious about **machine learning**, **AI applications**, and **web development**.

I'm adaptive, collaborative, and someone who enjoys working in diverse environments. Whether it's writing clean code, designing systems, or working on a hackathon challenge — I love it all!

I also enjoy connecting with people from around the globe. If you share the same enthusiasm for tech or have cool ideas to build — don’t just say “hi”, **tell me your story** 😊💬
